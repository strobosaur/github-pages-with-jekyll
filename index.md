Beginner programmer looking to improve and learn, and maybe even do some good along the way :)

Quick language summary:
* GML / Game Maker Studio (Intermediate+)
* C++ (Beginner+)
* C# (Beginner-)

In the past i've done some work on 16bit lookalike 2d games in Game Maker Studio, including:
* Random Level Generation
  * Cellular Automata
  * Mid Point Displacement Maps
  * Random Walk algorithms
  * Dungeons with connected rooms
  * Random Neighbourhood Graphs
  * Mixes of the above, and other more or *less* useful experiments ;)
* Tile mappers
  * Scripts for identifying terrain tile type in grids, and:
  * Placing correct tile of 8 possible directions (corners, NSWE, etc)
* Simple shaders
  * Chromatic abberation, and other simple color, light, and viewport position-manipulators
* Simple AI's
  * Mostly (only?) state machines of varying complexity
* Steering Behaviours
  * Simulation of weight and velocity in i.e. moving spacecraft
  * AI that is not completely (but close to) useless when controling the above craft
* Simple pathfinding
* Simple inventory and experience/progression systems
* Simple simulation of physics
* Lots of different scripts for randomized particle-effects to make things juicy

The project i spent the most time on (all code and graphics) can be seen in [this youtube video](https://youtu.be/eIvsM_l7sc4), but there are lots of smaller projects and random generation sandbox-programs lying around.

Recently i've been trying to learn some *proper* programming languages, and i just finished a summer course in C++ which i had lots of fun with. Since i finished with more than a month to spare, before enrolling in a 3yr program in Information Systems this fall of 2020, a teacher recommended i get on GitHub if i wanted to learn more in the meantime. So here i am :)

I'm interested in doing just about anything i *can* do, and while i have some experience in game-related stuff, i'm open to work on... Yeah - just about anything :)
